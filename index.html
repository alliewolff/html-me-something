            <article>Milo Wolff came to us in May of 2015 at 8 weeks old. He was the runt of the litter and weighed only <br>3 pounds when we got him. He's a medium-sized Goldendoodle.</article>

            Milo immediately made himself at home and stole our hearts. He doesn't know a stranger and loves absolutely everyone he meets. He's the happiest, friendliest dog you'll find.

            <p>
            Since then, he has celebrated two birthdays, our engagement and our wedding. He's been on trips with us, made tons of new friends and become part of the (extended) family.

            Our lives wouldn't be the same without Milo pup, and they certainly wouldn't be as fun.
